Gameplay Mechanics

Time-Based Gameplay: A timer constantly counts down from one minute. Players must strategically navigate the dungeon to reset the timer by reaching certain locations, using gold/currency. Resetting the timer becomes progressively more expensive.

Enemy Difficulty Scaling: If the timer hits zero, enemies become significantly stronger, making survival difficult. Players must then escape the dungeon with their loot.

Boss Encounter: Players' main goal is to defeat the boss at the end of the dungeon to halt the timer and obtain substantial loot. After defeating the boss, players can explore the dungeon without time pressure.

Dungeon Mechanics

Procedural Generation: Dungeons are procedurally generated with premade rooms, ensuring each playthrough is unique.
