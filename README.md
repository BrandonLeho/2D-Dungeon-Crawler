Gameplay Mechanics

Time-Based Gameplay: A timer constantly counts down from one minute. Players must strategically navigate the dungeon to reset the timer by reaching certain locations, using gold/currency. Resetting the timer becomes progressively more expensive.

Enemy Difficulty Scaling: If the timer hits zero, enemies become significantly stronger, making survival difficult. Players must then escape the dungeon with their loot.

Boss Encounter: Players' main goal is to defeat the boss at the end of the dungeon to halt the timer and obtain substantial loot. After defeating the boss, players can explore the dungeon without time pressure.

_________________________________________________________________________
Camp Mechanics

Camp Hub: After completing a dungeon, players return to camp where they can:

Rest to regain full health.

Upgrade gear at the blacksmith.

Purchase items from a merchant.

Gain extra temporary health by spending time with a prostitute (cost gold).

Gamble gold/currency at blackjack and/or texas hold'em tables (texas hold'em available only in multiplayer).

_________________________________________________________________________
Progression Systems

Leveling System: Players can spend points on attributes such as health, stamina, magic, strength, dexterity, intelligence, and luck, similar to Elden Ring's leveling system.

Weapon Variety: Players can choose from multiple weapons, including basic swords, polearms, axes, greatswords, katanas, firearms (e.g., Glock, AK47, Sniper), and explosive weapons (e.g., RPG, nuke). Weapons can be upgraded at the blacksmith.

_________________________________________________________________________
Dungeon Mechanics

Procedural Generation: Dungeons are procedurally generated with premade rooms, ensuring each playthrough is unique.

Scaling Difficulty and Loot: Enemies and loot scale based on the number of completed dungeons. Subsequent dungeons feature higher-level enemies and rarer loot, incentivizing progression and exploration.

_________________________________________________________________________
Multiplayer Mechanics

Cooperative Play: Multiplayer co-op mode allows up to 4 players to team up and explore dungeons together. Proximity chat will be feature.

Friendly Fire: nuff said.

Another Combat Update!1!!!1!

Changes Since Last Update:

-Improved Enemy AI (Now uses context steering)

-Added Health Bar, Stamina Bar, and Mana Bar (When hit, health and stamina will both deplete. Health cannot regen naturally, Stamina regens over time, Mana regens when landing hits with melee weapons)

-Added Parry and Block Mechanic (Parry last for a short time (0.25s). Parry negates all incoming damage and depletes enemy stamina. Block follows right after a parry and can be held indefinitely, but will only halve the damage taken for both health and stamina)

-Added Hit Pause (Screen pauses for a split second when landing a heavy blow/stance break)

-Added Weapon Switch (Only weapons available rn are sword and katana)

-Added Stance Break (When player's or enemy's stamina reaches below zero, they will be forced into a stunned state where they cannot move. While in this state, they take double the damage)

The compression kinda ruined the lighting for the torches, but it looks better in-game, trust
